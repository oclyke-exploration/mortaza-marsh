# mortaza-marsh
a simple Web BLE streaming demo for the SparkFun Artemis Dev Kit

# getting started
* ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your computer
* load the firmware onto the Artemis Dev Kit
  * use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and open the sketch located in ```/firmware```
* host the web page locally
  * run ```yarn install``` in the root to install required packages
  * run ```yarn start``` to start the development server

# quickstart
for the time being the web app is hosted at https://echoictech.com/mortaza-marsh - you can simply drag + drop the pre-built firmware binary (```firmware/firmware.ino.bin```) onto your SparkFun Artemis Dev Kit and then connect via bluetooth
